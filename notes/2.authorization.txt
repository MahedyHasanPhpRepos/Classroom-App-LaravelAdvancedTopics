now we will add a new column in our users table named role and default value will be student

php artisan make:migration add_role_to_users_table

then we will make controller named DashboardController which is invokable 

now we will write our logic after login which type of dashboard should be loaded or redirect to specific dashboard for specific role 

but we noticing that teacher can access admin dashboard 
or student can access teacher dashboard and admin dashboard 
so we need a middleware to check authenticated logged in user role and 
not allow to dashboard with other's role 

now we are creating middleware and Register it first to app/Http/Kernel.php file 
and 

 protected $middlewareAliases //section 

 after define we will set our middleware to our routes in web.php
 everything is settup now we will write our check logic for role 

php artisan make:controller ScheduledClassController --resource
